-> Breadth First Search (BFS) is a technique used to traverse a tree or graph.
-> This also called the level order traversal technique.
-> In this traversal, the nodes are visited level by level.
-> The main idea of level order traversal is to traverse all the nodes of a 
   lower level before moving to any of the nodes of a higher level.
-> BFS is used to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph.
