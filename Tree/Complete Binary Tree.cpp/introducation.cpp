   of the tree are completely filled except possibly for the last level and the
   last level has all its nodes to the left side.

-> A Complete Binary Tree is said to be a proper binary tree where all leaves
    have the same depth length or same level.
    
-> In a Complete Binary Tree number of nodes at depth d is 2^d.

-> In a Complete Binary Tree with n nodes heigth of the tree is log(n+1).
