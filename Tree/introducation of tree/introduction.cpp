-> Tree data structure is hierarchial structure that is used to represent and organize
   data in the form of parent child relationship.
-> The Topmost element is root element and the elements below it are called children.
-> The elements that are at the same level are called siblings.
-> The elements that are at the bottom  are called leaves.

Type of the tree:
1. Binary Tree 
2. Ternary Tree
3. N-ary Tree or Generic Tree

Binary Tree:
-> A tree in which each node has at most 2 children.
-> The children are called left child and right child.
-> The left child is always inserted,removed,visited,processed first and then 
   the right child.


Types of Binary Tree:
1. Full Binary Tree:
-> A binary tree in which each node has exactly 0 or 2 children.


2. Complete Binary Tree:
-> A binary tree in which all the levels are completely filled except possibly 
   the last level.
-> In the last level, all the nodes are as left as possible.
-> A binary tree in which all the levels are completely filled except possibly 
   the last level and the last level is filled from left to right.

3. Perfect Binary Tree:
-> A binary tree in which all the levels are completely filled and 
   all the nodes have 2 children.

4. Balanced Binary Tree:
-> A binary tree in which the height of the left subtree and the height of the 
   right subtree of each node differ by at most 1 or 0.


Ternary Tree:
-> A tree in which each node has at most 3 children.
-> The children are called left child, middle child and right child.
-> The left child is always inserted,removed,visited,processed first and then the 
   middle child and then the right child.


N-ary Tree or Generic Tree:
-> A tree in which each node has at most N children
-> The children are called first child, second child, third child and so on.
-> The first child is always inserted,removed,visited,processed first and then the 
   second child and then the third child and so on.


Tree Traversal:
1. Depth First Traversal:
-> In this traversal, the nodes are visited in depthwise order.
-> The nodes are visited from the root to the leaf nodes.
-> The nodes are visited in the following order:
   a. Preorder Traversal
   b. Inorder Traversal
   c. Postorder Traversal

2. Breadth First Traversal:
-> In this traversal, the nodes are visited in breadthwise order.
-> The nodes are visited level by level.
-> The nodes are visited in the following order:
   a. Level Order Traversal
