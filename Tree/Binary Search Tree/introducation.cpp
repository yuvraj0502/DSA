-> A Binary Search Tree (or BST) is a data structure used in computer 
   science for organizing and storing data in a sorted manner. Each node 
   in a Binary Search Tree has at most two children, a left child and a right 
   child, with the left child containing values less than the parent node and 
   the right child containing values greater than the parent node.

-> The left subtree every node value is less than the root nodes.

-> The rigbt subtree eveye node valus is greater than the root nodes.

-> The left and right subtree each must also a binary search tree.

-> There must be no duplicate nodes.

-> A Binary Search Tree is useful for maintaining a sorted list of data 
   and allows for fast search, insert, and delete operations.
